##Exercise 6b - Vectors 

### Due October 25th

1. Take one of your previous exercises and transition it to P5 and OOP. Construct your classes so that each object has it's own position

2. Add vectors to your class, in order to control motion of your graphics. Add vectors for velocity and acceleration. 



Bonus:

- create multiple objects with different velocities and accelerations. Store them in an array.

- Have these objects move towards different goals: the mouse, a particular graphic/monster, etc.
