###Show and Tell

You will be assigned a Show and Tell presentation date. See the calendar. Please research the assigned artist/designers/firms/pieces/collectives in advance. Each presentation will be about 5-7 minutes long. Be able to address the following, along with *3-4 visual examples of each individual or team's work*: (2 points each)

• Show us the work! Show us video!

• What is original/unique about how this artist uses technology? 

• What kind of code did the artist use?  (JavaScript? Flash? Procesing? openFrameworks? VVVV?) How are they using the code? What is the code achieving?

• Why is it necessary that the artist use code?  (ie: particularly if it’s non-interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)

• Your presentation must be prepared and professional. It can be made with slides. It can just be browser tabs. It doesn't not have to be incredibly formal and stiff. It's more important that YOU are familar with their work and how it is made. Talk about this! Do not only discuss your thoughts of the work. The presentation must include facts about the pieces and the creators. What's their design process?

• If you have slides, DO NOT READ OFF YOUR SLIDES. Show the work. Discuss the work. I repeat - DO NOT READ OFF YOUR SLIDES. Use presentor notes or note cards.
