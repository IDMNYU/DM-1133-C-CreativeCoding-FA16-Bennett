Exercise 9: Data + API

EXTRA CREDIT

Use a third-party API to get data into your code that you use in some manner. This could be a data visualization, or some other graphical intergration in a visual/sonic context. If you are using an API for your final project, you must use a different API.

This must not be just a recycled version of a previous example, nor the examples in the text. Use those as your guide, but build a new exercise.

It must also incorporate previous concepts that you've learned in class - custom functions, custom classes, time manipulation, arrays, interactivity, etc.

Make it visually interesting and dynamic!
