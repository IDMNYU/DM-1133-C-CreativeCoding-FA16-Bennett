Exercise 8: String Manipulations + API's

Take a data set of some sort (text, API, JSON, XML) as an input. Your code should parse the input, looking for key/value pairs or some other rhythm inherent in the data (ex, spacing between words, commas, periods, etc).

The output should be evident in some way, whether this is visually through text, or some other way of visualizing the information.
