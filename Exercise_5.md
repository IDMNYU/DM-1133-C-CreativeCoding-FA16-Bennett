 Exercise 5

 MonsterX

 Take 2 monsters from 2 students in this class. Translate that Processing code to P5.js. Make each monster it's own function. Pass parameters to each call, making each monster different from the last, using size and/or color. Call these functions 3 different times.

 Then make them interactive on input. They could move and/or appear.

Make sure to attribute the original code to the students and to comment each line of their code!
