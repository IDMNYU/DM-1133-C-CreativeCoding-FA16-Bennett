# Final Project: Choice   30% of your Final Grade

##Dates: 
### Working Prototype Due: Tuesday November 22nd
### Beta Version Due: Tuesday November 29th
### Alpha Version Due: Tuesday December 13th for inclass presentations

Working Prototype: All media should be gathered; basic functionality should be evident and working in your code. Code should be commented with pseudo code for future functionality.

Beta Version: Greater sophistication of your code should be evident along with interactivity/time elements/working API's/3rd Party Libraries (ie, physics engines, sound, animation, etc). Your code should be working. Bugs are present, but you've already squashed quite a few. Several things may still need to be worked out

Alpha Version: No bugs present. Smooth functionality to your code: interactivity, time, API's, smooth intergration with 3rd Party Libraries


This is the culmination of this class. As a result, I expect you to not only demonstrate an understanding of concepts discussed this far, but a greater sophistication of them as well. In addition, your project should develop beyond the ideas discussed at the round table and your project should incorporate and include concepts discussed after week 8 (ie, string manipulation, 3rd party libraries, API's, vectors + forces, etc). 

If you need assistance planning out your project stages, please come hang out with me in my office hours. If you can't meet durining that time, email me.

Good Luck!



Option 1- Persuasion: Choose a current event, news item, or issue that you feel strongly about and make a piece that addressees it.  Think of it as an interactive, algorithmic documentary.    The emphasis of this project is using code to be persuasive.  How can you convey a point of view in using procedural generation and interactivity?

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics, change over time


Option 2 - High Score: Design and program a game. This project focuses on motion and interaction. To place the focus on those two components exclusively, the visual elements will be minimal. The visual components of the game are restricted to ~6 basic shapes on the screen at a time, but you may use any motion or interaction technique that you can imagine. You many use only lines, circles, and rectangles, but you may also use simple typography to keep score or show other basic data. These restrictions have been defined to minimize the complexity of the project, to encourage you to be creative within constraints, and to place the emphasis on the qualities of the interaction. After you have completed the game as geometry, you may choose to “skin” the game.

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics, change over time


Option 3 - Interactive Narrative: Using a pre-existing narrative, or create your own, create an interactive narrative. Remember, that choice is paramount with interactivity. As a result, your story should have multiple paths to explore. This can be literal or it can be abstract. Experiment with time!

Ingredients: graphics, interactivity, image, video, sound, text, time structures, change, OOP, change over time


Option 4 - Choose your own adventure: Come up with your own idea, and describe it to us. Bring in examples, assests, and references of various Artists, Designers, Programmers, Games, Firms, Projects, etc. We do not exist in a vacuum.
