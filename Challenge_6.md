##Challenge 4: Franken-monster

###OOP: Inheritance and Polymorphism 

The goal of this challenge is to have (at least) one parent class and 3 children classes (4 classes total). Store the objects of these classes on one array. Use that array to illustrate these objects.
 
Create a base class as a parent class to work off of. Keep this base class simple. But think about it's construction, in order to build it strong.  Have a method to display something simple (Ex. eyes(), mouth(), head(), body(), legs()). Have a method to control movement and/or to update variables.

Pull code from (at least) two monsters from other students (see the repo links below). This could be from Exercise 1, Exercise 5, or Challenge 5. Use this code to create various body parts. Ensure that you are also passing parameters to these methods to enable motion of the body part. Transform the code into 3 child classes from the parent. Assemble these children classes to be a conglomerate of body parts from other student's monsters. Use various methods to activate or show parts. Not all parts have to be shown at once. 

You must be creative and play with mixing body parts between monsters. Do not just recycle a monster in it's entire original form. Think: Frankenstein assembly of bodies.

Minimum: Use an array to store 4 different objects of these 4 classes you have created.

Going Further: Animate those monsters to move around your screen - either with time (frameCount + %) or user input. Use more than 6 different objects and store them in an array.

####Teams (first student listed is main one on the laptop, other(s) are supporting):

- Shane + Sawyer
- Amy + Ari
- Johanna + Bonnie
- Alice + Chris
- Yahya + Naz
- David + Joyce
- Samir + Lucas 
- Jarrett+ Miranda + Emily 

####Suggested Strategy:

- 5-10 minutes: Discussion of strategy: who's repos are you using, division of labor, areas of support identified. 
- 5 minutes: collect code from other repos
- 5 - 10 minutes: identify functions to be used (various body parts)
- 5 - 10 minutes: add parameters to allow for movement
- 5 minutes: create ase class
- 10 - 20 minutes: assembly to classes from various body parts based upon base class
- 15 minutes: illustrate them visually using an array
- 15 minutes: create motion amongst them
