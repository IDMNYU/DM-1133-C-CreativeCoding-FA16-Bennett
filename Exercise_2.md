Exercise 2 Kandinsky Comp 8
			
Redraw a cropped section of Kandinsky's Composition 8

Exercise 2: Redraw Crop from Kandinsky's Composition 8 (see Slack Resources). Make sure that the file is at least 300 DPI. Then select an interesting/ambitious crop, then load it into a program such as Photoshop or Illustrator to read the color and coordinate data. Use integer values for coordinates and use the following functions for drawing: line(), triangle(), quad(), rect(), ellipse(), arc(), and beginShape(), endShape(), vertex(). Focus on color, using the color picker in Adobe to get the RGB & HSB values.

Note that by passsing a 4th value to Fill() - ie, fill(255, 0, 0, 255) - will control the alpha channel, otherwise known as opacity. Full opacity will be 255. Being completely transparent will be 0. See the color tutorial on Processing's website for information about transparency. Also note that color can also be a data type.
