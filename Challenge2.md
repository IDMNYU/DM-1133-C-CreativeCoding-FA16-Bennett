Challenge 2:


With your partner, create a new sketch in P5.js.

	- Your monster and your partner's monster must be present as independent functions and smaller functions. Parameters must be utilized in order to make the monsters be unique.

	- Incorporate the new monster, doing the same. Create functions to control it with variables and parameters to make each call to it unique. Within this new monster, make a body part of this monster to be it's own function. You may do more than one, if you wish. Structure the function so that you will be able to move that body part

	- With this body part, animate it by either input (keyboard + mouse) or time.

	- In this sketch, create a crowd of 9 these monsters - 3 calls each, with each monster being unique. Color, location, scale, composition are a few examples.

	- Explore movement. How can you make it controlled and unique?
