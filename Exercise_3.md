 Exercise 3

 Repetition: Modularity, Pattern

 Using 1 form/shape and create 6 drastically different grid patterns. Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. 

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique

 - how could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change?
