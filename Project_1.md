**Due Oct 11 --> In class critiques**

**20% of your final grade**

Weekly pushes and changes are expected

Pick an adjective and make a program that illustrates that adjective interactively. You may not use images.  Only drawing functions, meaning mostly stuff found in the ‘graphics’ section.
The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be using only lines, shapes, colors?

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?

Ingredients: Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custome shapes), Control Structures (if, for, while), Movement, Interaction (mouse, keyboard), Custom functions, Random.

Must haves:
	- custom functions
	- use of loops
	- use of control structures
	- some use of random
	- custom functions that utilize variables as parameters
	- some use of interaction or change over time
	- movement
	- math


Code must be 100 lines of custom code, a minimum. Spacing, comments or commented out code are not counted as lines.

Weekly pushes to your GitHub Repo are required
