# RoundTable Discussion Preparation

* Use the 1 one of the storyboard templates (see this repo for the folder).
			* Develop 4 DIFFERENT ideas for a final project. For each idea:

			* Use the template to illustrate:
				- What it would look like through various stages (interaction, time)
				- Show the various stages on a macro-scale (far away) and micro-scale (close up, zoomed in)
				- System design: What does your software interact with? Humans? Then show the interface AND the system design. Other software? Draw a software map showing when, how and under what conditions the pieces of software interact.
				- Bring in outside references, links and resources demonstrating:
					* Similar artists, designers, projects, games, methods, visuals, audio
					* Links to processes involved or influences by (code, biology, weather patterns, the sky is the limit)
					* Contextual information about the concept, meaning, expression, goal

		* You must do this entire process 4 times - once for each idea
		* Prepare a 4 minute presentation on these 4 ideas. Have your links ready to go, images scanned and slides ready. Be able to discuss your idea.
